## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

The most common sentiment observed in my sample of 50 reviews is negative. There are more than 30 negative reviews.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

The labels are somewhat reliable. For review number 11, my openai function got both positive and negative because one part of the review praised the product while it was an an 11 oz box but also criticize the same product when it was in the 14oz product. The risk that model hallucination introduce is adding reviews and misunderstanding some connotations.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

I would recommend that Cocunut Water producer change their product to another container. There are a lot of negative comments about the plastic. When I asked openai to show the most common word in the negative reviews disregrading prepostions and the word coconut, there were 12 instances of plastic being talked about. Additionally, these comments:
 - "it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself."
 - "It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!" 
 -  "My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water."
 - "I used to LOVE zico tetra pack. this new stuff in new bottle is super plasticy and ugly. !!"
highlight the plastic is a concern and a reason for the bad reviews. There exists an opportunity for the company to improve its product.
